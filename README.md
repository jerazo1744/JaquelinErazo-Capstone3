# Capstone 3: InstaCart

Analyzing data from InstaCart. Finding the number of orders based on the day of the week and hour of the day (irrespective to the day of the week). Additionally, found the Top 5 Products for each day. Created all of my visualizations on Tableau and did a frequency chart based on the days between orders and conducted a t-test on the average of prior order days based on the 2nd and 3rd order numbers.
